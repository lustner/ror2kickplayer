# Kick Player Mod for Risk of Rain 2

Kick toxic players. Do not abuse.

## How to use
In chat, type

**_kick {player name or index}**

The player index is the order they appear in lobby, starting at 0 (the host). So to kick the third player (index = 2) shown on screen, use

**_kick 2**
  
If you prefer to use the in-game console, use the command

**kick_player {player name or index}**

In console, you can also list players to see their index and name:

**list_players**
